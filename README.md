### So i just uploaded all the files that i will be using.. In next few days, there will be some nice changes and progress on project.

The only thing left is responsive view.. it will be done soon and project will be good to go.

### Skill:
----------
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap 3 ( Just for Layout )
* Javascript
* jQUery
---------------------------------

I decided to not use SASS/SCSS for this, maybe in the future i will change from CSS3 to SASS for better organisation.
